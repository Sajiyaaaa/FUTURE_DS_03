# 🎓 College Event Feedback Analysis – Internship Project

##  Project Overview

College events such as tech fests, workshops, and cultural activities often collect feedback from participants — but this feedback is not always used effectively.

This project focuses on analyzing both **rating-based** and **textual feedback** submitted by students after attending campus events. Using survey data collected via Google Forms (CSV format), the project applies **data analysis** and **basic Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to measure satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

##  Objectives

- Analyze student feedback to understand event effectiveness
  
- Identify satisfaction trends based on ratings
  
- Perform sentiment analysis on textual comments
  
- Provide actionable insights to improve future college events  

##  What This Project Does

- Cleans and prepares feedback data from Google Form exports

- Analyzes ratings (1–5 scale) to find satisfaction patterns
  
- Uses NLP techniques to classify feedback as **positive, neutral, or negative**
  
- Visualizes trends using charts and graphs
  
- Suggests improvements based on data-driven insights  

##  Skills Gained

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**

- Sentiment analysis using **TextBlob / VADER**
  
- Data visualization with **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
  
- Creating **bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds**
  
- Interpreting survey data for decision-making
  
- Working in **Google Colab** (no local setup required)
